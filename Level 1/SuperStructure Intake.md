## Success Criteria
- [ ] Create an "over the bumper" intake system
- [ ] Add a controller button to engage the intake process. It must retract when released
- [ ] The button must automatically stop and retract the intake when a game piece is retracted

#### Synopsis
Intake complexity can range from very simple rollers that capture a game piece, to complex actuated systems intertwined with other scoring mechanisms. 

A common "over the bumper" intake archetype is a deployed system that
- Actuates outward past the frame perimeter
- Engages rollers to intake game piece
- Retracts with the game piece upon completion of a game piece

The speed of deployment and retraction both impact cycle times, forming a critical competitive aspect of the bot. 

The automatic detection and retraction provide cycle advantages (streamlining the driver experience), but also prevent fouls and damage due to the collisions on the deployed mechanism.
