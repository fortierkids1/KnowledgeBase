## Success Criteria
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Covering system "state" is very useful, especially in subsystems
- [ ] ConditionalCommand + SelectCommand can be useful for attributing actions and states on simple systems

- [ ] Need to find a sensible formal way to cover it; It's easy to make "custom" state machines for simple systems, but hard to scale up in complexity with consistent patterns.

#### Possible state model
  - States of Unloaded, unaligned, loaded, scoring
