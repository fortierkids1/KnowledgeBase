## Resetting The NavX
- Hold CAL button for at least 5 seconds
- Release CAL button, the CAL light should flash for 1 second before turning off
- Press RESET button and wait 10-15 seconds

>[!danger] Indicator Lights
>The NavX should have a red power indicator light illuminated while it is on. If there are no lights, something is wrong and the NavX is not getting power. Check for a pin short on the RoboRIO (this has happened to us before).
