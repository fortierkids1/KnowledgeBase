## Troubleshooting






### Compiling code

##### Error: JDK Not found
If you get an error reading something along the lines of 
   JDK Not found. 
   Path currently set to "C:/Program Files/java/jre8..."
then you can correct it by going to `Windows > Preferences >Java >Installed JREs`. 
Then add `Standard VM`, and set `java home` to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk8..\` 
(Note, JDK, _not_ JRE). Click Finish, then select JDK In installed JREs, and OK.
