Git-Testing
===========

Welcome StormBots!

I'm setting this up as a handy way to quickly test out git features in a safe environment, while we set things up. 

There's not much here quite yet, but feel free to check out the available resources. 


Learning Java
==============

[FRC Java Center](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/frcjava.html)

[Getting Started with Java for FRC](http://first.wpi.edu/Images/CMS/First/Getting_Started_with_Java_for_FRC.pdf)

[WPLib Getting Started](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/3120/m/7885/l/79405-installing-the-java-development-tools) Walks you through programming your first robot.



Learning Git and Github
=======================

Don't let the complexity of all the commands fool you. A lot of what we'll be doing with Git is built in to the IDE, or the [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) application. The important thing is to get the general feel for what the commands are called, and what they do.

Also of note, there's several different guides because they approach Git in different ways, some of which may jive with your brain better. Don't think that you need to fully understand all the commands, only the general workflow and tasks. Ask questions if need be!

[Github plugin for Eclipse](http://eclipse.github.com/)

[Github Plugin for NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/kb/73/ide/git.html)


Basics
------
[Using GitHub](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-github/) Very good general overview, particularly for using the GitHub for Windows application. 

[Git: The simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) This one does a great job of describing the various tasks in Git.

[Git in 5 minutes](http://classic.scottr.org/presentations/git-in-5-minutes/)

[Pushing and Pulling](http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/21/pushing-and-pulling.html) Has a very nice visual reference for what's happening with the commands.


More advanced git stuff
-----------------------

[Getting Started with Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started), which is much more comprehensive, and a pretty good resource for advanced use. Kelson, you'll want to read this.

[Interactive Git Cheatsheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html). Very cool for figuring out what goes from where to where. 


Python Tutorials
=============================

This stuff is intended for Jacob T, who will be working with this. 


Board Communication
----------------

[Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) Network protocol library for Python. There's a chance we may use this for communication, depending on simplicity.
We might still use I2C, assuming that the OS supports running it in slave mode. Not finding a lot of documentation at the moment. 

SimpleCV
--------
[Pycon Discussion](http://simplecv.org/news/2013/03/simplecv-talk-pycon) Long, excellent talk, gives a very good basis for what we'll be doing.

[SimpleCV tutorials](http://tutorial.simplecv.org/en/latest/) Enough said. 

While going through these, you'll hear "histogram" mentioned a lot. This [photography discussion](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/understanding-histograms.shtml) has a very good explanation of what they are, and how to read them. After that, what the manipulations of them makes a lot more sense.
