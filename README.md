# Skyview Robotics Knowledgebase

This is the Skyview Robotics training wiki and educational resources


### What this is about
Robotics does not have a linear path to success; There's a lot of variety in what you'll need to do, and a bigger variety in what you _want_ to do. So, instead of a standard curriculum, our resources are broken down as skill trees that build up and out from smaller, foundational sections.

Brand new programmers will likely need to start with the very fundamentals of coding: 
[[Coding Basics.canvas|Coding Basics]]

Once you're ready to move some hardware, the [[StormBreakers Tree.canvas|StormBreakers Tree]] is intended to guide new students to meet the challenges of a fully working, competitive Kitbot.

Lastly, our [[Stormbots Tree.canvas|Stormbots Tree]]  builds on experience, and emphasizes deeper dives into advancing specific skills, and blending varied skill sets together. This tree is intended to guide students through more complex designs and higher performance targets. It also builds and relies upon the [[StormBreakers Tree.canvas|StormBreakers Tree]], which will remain a valuable resource.

While any particular page will likely prove somewhat useful on it's own, everything will be written with the assumption you're caught up according to these trees. 
### Setup
This notebook is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) notebook, and some features of it may not fully work outside of Obsidian.
