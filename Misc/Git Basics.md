## Goals
Understand the typical Git operations most helpful for day-to-day programming

## Completion Requirements
This module is intended to be completed alongside other tasks.

- [ ] Initialize a git repository in your project
- [ ] Create an initial commit
- [ ] Create several commits representing simple milestones in your project
- [ ] When moving to a new skill card, create a new branch to represent it. Create as many commits on the new branch as necessary to track your work for this card. 
- [ ] When working on a skill card that does _not_ rely on the previous branch, switch to your `main` branch, and create a new branch to  represent that card.
- [ ] On completion of that card (or card sequence), merge the results of both branches back into Main.
- [ ] Upon resolving the merge, ensure both features work as intended.
