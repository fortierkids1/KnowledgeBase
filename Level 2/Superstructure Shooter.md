## Success Criteria
- [ ] 

Typically a "shooter" consists of 
- a [[SuperStructure Flywheel]] to serve as a mechanical means to maintain momentum
- A [[Superstructure Indexer]] to time shots and ensure the shooter is at the indended speed
- A targeting system, often using Odometry or Vision
- A trajectory evaluation to control target RPM. This can be fixed targets, [[Lookup Tables]], or more complex trajectory calculations
