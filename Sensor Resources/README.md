# Sensor Resources

The [WPILIB Screensteps](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809) page has a huge list of sensors, actuators, and code examples. 


The team's Sonar sensors are detailed at [MaxBotix](http://www.maxbotix.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors/MB1003.htm). Typically, these are utilized as Analog sensors, 

The IMU we'll be using on the roboRio is the [navX MXP](http://www.kauailabs.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=56). 
Details about the system and the code libraries availible from that link and from the project's [Google Code repository](https://code.google.com/p/navx-mxp/?redir=1)
